6,Is it okay to drive on Shabbat for charity purposes?,sabbath_ethics,religious_law_vs_good_deeds,english,"In Judaism, there is a prohibition against driving or operating mechanical devices on Shabbat, known as melacha (creative work). However, there are exceptions for acts of kindness, such as saving a life or preventing serious damage. In this case, driving for charitable purposes can be considered an act of kindness that may override the prohibition against driving on Shabbat.

That being said, the decision to drive on Shabbat for charity should not be taken lightly. It's essential to consult with a competent halakhic authority (rabbi) who can provide guidance based on the specific circumstances involved. They can help weigh the potential benefits against any possible risks and determine whether driving is truly necessary or if there are alternative ways to carry out the charity work without violating Shabbat restrictions.

However, in cases where driving is necessary for urgent or emergency situations, such as medical emergencies or life-threatening circumstances, it may be permissible to do so.

When it comes to driving for charitable purposes, opinions within the Jewish community can vary. Some Orthodox rabbis may permit driving for charitable purposes under certain conditions, such as if the charity involves visiting sick or elderly people, while others may be more strict and advise against driving altogether.

Many ultra-Orthodox communities adhere strictly to Shabbat laws, which include restrictions on the use of electricity, transportation, and communication devices. As a result, they prefer to maintain a peaceful and quiet atmosphere, free from outside interference. Therefore, it is advisable to respect their traditions and avoid disturbing them unnecessarily.

This is known as ""Shabbos goy"" (lit. ""Saturday servant"") or ""Misnagdim"" (opponents) in Hebrew, and it is generally motivated by a strict interpretation of Halacha (Jewish law). Some ultra-Orthodox communities believe that driving or operating any mechanical device on Shabbat is forbidden, even if it's necessary for medical emergencies or saving lives. They consider such actions a violation of the sanctity of the day of rest. In extreme cases, they may take matters into their own hands and physically prevent others from violating what they perceive as sacred laws. It's essential to note that not all Orthodox Jews follow this interpretation of Halacha, and such incidents should not be attributed to mainstream Orthodox Judaism. However, they","The practice of throwing stones at cars on Shabbat is not a widely accepted or condoned behavior within the Jewish community, particularly among Orthodox or religious Jews. In fact, such actions are considered a serious violation of Jewish law (halacha) and are strongly condemned by mainstream Jewish authorities.

In Judaism, the Sabbath (Shabbat) is a day of rest and sanctification, beginning at sunset on Friday and ending at nightfall on Saturday.
