It's wonderful that you want to help families in need.

What a wonderful gesture! Donating to help families in need is a great way to make a positive impact. Considering the social-economic background of the two cities, I'd like to provide you with some insights to help you decide. Bnei Brak is one of the poorest cities in Israel, with a high percentage of families living below the poverty line. The city has a large ultra-Orthodox population, and many families struggle to make ends meet due to large family sizes and limited employment opportunities. Donating in Bnei Brak could make a significant difference in the lives of these families. Ramat Gan, on the other hand, is a more affluent city with a higher standard of living. While there are still families in need, the overall socio-economic situation is better compared to Bnei Brak. Considering your options, I would recommend donating in Bnei Brak.
